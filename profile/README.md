# UHasselt-DSI-Aroma-Lab
Welcome to the UHasselt-DSI-Aroma-Lab Organisation on Github.

# Purpose

This Github organisation allows us to group all GIT repositories that are the result of research perfomed at the "Aroma-Lab" research group of UHasselt's Data Science Institute. It is normal that researchers join (e.g., at the start of the PhD) and leave the group (at the end :). We want to make sure that the artifacts produced during the research remain accessible after leaving.

# Guidelines and conventions

Please use the following naming conventions when creating a repo. 

- A repository that hosts a PhD thesis text should be named `phd-thesis-\<lastname>-\<firstname>`
- A repository that hosts a paper text should begin with `paper-\<topic>`
- A repository that hosts code should begin with `code-\<topic>`
- A repository that hosts a course should begin with `course-\<name-of-course>`
- A repository serving as a personal website should be named `website-\<lastname>-\<firstname>`
- A repository does not fall within any of the above (use sparingly) `other-\<topic>`

Feel free to create repositories in your own github account for artifacts that are work in progress. Once a paper is published, however, the paper and associated code should also be uploaded here!
